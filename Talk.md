# Single-Cell Talks

## Some of Single-cell Sequencing challenges are:
- Low amounts of input data for single-cell cases
- Technical noise such as batch effects are more of factor when genetic material are less.
- We really wanna remove noise to get as accurate as possible gene expression.


## Normalization
- With Spike-in Genes: By modeling technical noise around spike-in ERCC molecules
* SAMstrt
* BASiCS
* GRM
* WeBe: Weighted Between Groups Normalization (proposed by Nick)
** Normalization between known groups of cells further establishes ech group's identity
